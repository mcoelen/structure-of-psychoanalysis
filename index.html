<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>“[…] the word structure is no better than the word free association […]”<br>
(J. Lacan, … ou pire)<br>
“[...] that stupid structure of mine—turns out to be a knot [...]”<br>
(J. Lacan, Les non-dupes errent)</p>

<h2>Dissonance</h2>
<p>A peculiar dissonance: Whereas no science or theory today would claim to be exclusively “structuralist,” would embrace “structure” as the first and last word on either the model or the real of its object, the term structure enjoys ample usage in psychoanalysis, especially where it defines itself under some influence of the teachings and writings by Jacques Lacan.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Does “Lacanian” psychoanalysis cling—for reasons perhaps justifiable—to a notion elsewhere seen as epistemologically obsolete? And then why? Or has the term simply fallen from a height of theoretical precision and rigor into the everydayness of language games where it is bestowed with a halo of gravity, and employed almost synonymously with “system,” “architecture,” “construction,” “inner core,” etc.? Is “structure” able to afford such imprecision? And what happens to structure—or to that, what the concept once tried to catch—if “structure” can mean almost anything and next to nothing? Is the sexual structural? Which afterlife of linguistic structuralism is implied in using “signifiers”? What do we inherit from the “elementary structures of kinship” in anthropology? Which resonances with “mathematical structures” could be taken into account? What affect does structure “trigger”?</p>

<h2>Structures</h2>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, how do the so-called “clinical structures,” or the “way someone is structured”—expressions often used as if designating the property, the inner make-up of a person, mind, or psyche—relate to the attempt at divesting psychoanalysis from psychology by minimalizing its vocabulary and projecting it onto a plane that is determined by the notion of “structure” and only a few others?</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>This seminar aims to address these questions and elaborate on their relevance for psychoanalytic theory and practice today. We will cover pieces of the history of structuralism as well as of the history of the term “structure” preceding or surrounding it; we will think through the theoretical implications of structure for psychoanalysis’s relation to contemporary science; we will confront the structure (in Lacan) with the psychic apparatus (in Freud) as well as the grid (in Bion); we will ask about “clinical structures” and their relevance in analytic work.</p>

<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>[October 17: introduction / structure as word, concept or—"structure" / moments of structure in Lacan / Bataille and heterogeneity // October 31: more introduction and on “structure” and heterogeneity in Bataille / in invention of linguistic structure / signifiers] // November 7: structure for structure, or: transformation in Levi-Strauss // November 21: structure in mathematics / formalism // December 12: Freud and formalist writing / the apparatus and the complex // January 9: is there structure in the grid? / Bion // January 16: back to Lacan // January 30: graphs, surfaces, knots—all structures? // February 13: structure to waste // February 27: is there a structure in the clinic? // March 13: ends of structure /// The syllabus is subject to transformation.</p>
